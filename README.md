# üöÑ AI Train Traffic Optimizer ‚Äî Hybrid Priority + Rollout

A **simulation prototype** for optimizing train traffic in a grid network.  
The app compares **Baseline FCFS (First Come First Serve)** with a custom **Hybrid Optimizer (priority + rollout)**, and demonstrates how AI (Groq stub) can be integrated for future deployment.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Baseline vs Hybrid Comparison**  
  FCFS scheduling compared against a hybrid optimizer that:
  - Uses train **priority, delay, and distance remaining**.
  - Resolves conflicts with a **1-step rollout lookahead**.
  - Falls back to greedy if needed.

- **Simulation Controls**
  - ‚ñ∂ Next Tick (advance simulation)
  - ‚ñ∂ Toggle Auto-Play (auto simulation with delay slider)
  - üîÑ Reset
  - üöß Breakdown (simulate disruption)
  - ‚è± Random Delay


- **Track Visualization**  
  - Grid network with trains (Express, Local, Freight).  
  - Color-coded movement with live updates.

- **KPIs Dashboard**
  - Avg Delay (minutes)  
  - Trains Completed  
  - Punctuality Rate (<5min delay)  
  - Current Simulation Time  

- **Baseline vs Hybrid Results**  
  - Side-by-side comparison of strategies.  
  - Bar charts for **average delay** and **throughput**.  
  - Success/warning message on performance.
